The uncertainty principle, also known as Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. It states that there is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously known. In other words, the more accurately one property is measured, the less accurately the other property can be known. More formally, the uncertainty principle is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the product of the accuracy of certain related pairs of measurements on a quantum system, such as position, x, and momentum, p.[1] Such paired-variables are known as complementary variables or canonically conjugate variables. This principle, derived in 1921, is also a property that can cause many quantum states of a system to behave in quantum-like amounts. This principle has long been considered an index toward an underlying theory of quantum behavior.[2][3] It forms one part of a theory called a superspace—i.e. an extension—of the wavefunction in quantum theory on the so-called entanglement principle. This principle, derived in 1950, is also a property that can cause many quantum states of a system to behave in quantum-like amounts.

This principleIntroduced first in 1927 by German physicist Werner Heisenberg,[2] the uncertainty principle states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be predicted from initial conditions, and vice versa. In the published 1927 paper, Heisenberg originally concluded that the uncertainty principle was ΔpΔq ≈ h using the full Planck constant.[2][3][4][5] The formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position σx and the standard deviation of momentum σp was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard[6] later that year and by Hermann Weyl[7] in 1928. This equality is also expressed in terms of the result of the Weyl–Hess equation.[2][3][4][4,5,6][8][9] However, in 1926 Heisenberg proposed in theory the notion of a special relation ΦpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔ, where π is a positive constant which corresponds with an absolute value Φp. This special relation ΦpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσΔpσ�
In matrix mechanics, the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, any pair of non-commuting self-adjoint operators representing observables are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable A is performed with an apparatus (not shown), a wavefunction result, e, is calculated (viz., the wavefunction) for the measurement value. Then a wavefunction w of a wavefunction result E
  = A  = 0  = -E  = 0  = -E1 is provided as follows:where a,b, and c indicate states of V1, V2, and C1, and respectively the wavefunction w of V1, V2, and C1 is varied for all measurements. Then a,b, and c will be called eigenstates of the wavefunction w, and it can be calculated that for all measurements of the wavefunction w, E
  = A  = 0  = -E1 is provided as follows:where a,b, and c indicate states of V1, V2, and C1, and respectively the wavefunction w of V1, V2, and C1 is varied for all measurements
